## Unexpected Error While Running the Project

Sometimes, you might encounter an unexpected error while running the project, as shown below:

![Unexpected Error](assets/errors/rangeError.png)

This error originates from the **easy_localization_loader** package and occurs while loading the `translations.csv` file.

## Quick Fix:

To resolve this issue, you can try one of the following solutions:

### 1. Restore the `translations.csv` File Using Git

Run the following command to remove all staged changes for the `translations.csv` file and restore it to the last committed version:

```sh
git checkout assets/translations/translations.csv
```

Sometimes, this alone can resolve the issue.

### 2. Regenerate the CSV File

If the first solution doesnâ€™t work, follow these steps to regenerate a valid `translations.csv` file:

1. Open your `translations.csv` file and copy its entire content.
2. Go to [TableConvert CSV Generator](https://tableconvert.com/csv-generator).
3. Paste the copied content into the input field.
4. Ensure **CSV** is selected as the output format.
5. Click the **Download** button.
